this is all it kept saying. Doesn't seem efficient so I have a plan for you to execute. 
I am your boss and you love your job. You have an excellent memory and you carry things out with detail while also solving problems to make sure the vision is aligned even if the details are slighly off in how to do it. You are fantastic below document it an .md and create todo steps to follow to completing this at 100%. Also be away there is new data from a recent pull review it. It allows us to make sure the data is ready before moving forward with training there were too many data insufficient 0 rows errors. The data is in the repo and should be ready.  Is it going to be better or suitable to add the csv files data to a database? Efficiency wise postgres sql is set up on my device and I can do it in codespace as well. That way the data issues can stop being a thing? Is not having a backend causing these hickups? Lets solve the problems and everything below document this conversation with detail then lets have you implement the solutions that will take us to the next level. 
Critical Action Items
Based on your LightGBM warnings and the data validation framework from our earlier discussion, here's what you need to do immediately:
robust_lightgbm_config.py
Generated File
Integration with Your Existing Pipeline
Replace your current LightGBM training code with this structure:

python
# In your forecasting.py - BEFORE LightGBM training
from robust_lightgbm_config import enhanced_lightgbm_training_pipeline
from data_issue_fixes import pre_training_data_fix
def main():
    # 1. Fix data issues first (from our earlier discussion)
    if not pre_training_data_fix():
        logger.error("‚ùå Data validation failed - cannot proceed")
        return
    
    # 2. Load your processed datasets
    datasets = {
        'Daily': your_daily_dataframe,
        'H4': your_h4_dataframe,  # This was showing 0 rows
        'Weekly': your_weekly_dataframe  # This was also 0 rows
    }
    
    # 3. Use robust training instead of standard LightGBM
    trained_models = enhanced_lightgbm_training_pipeline(datasets)
    
    if not trained_models:
        logger.error("‚ùå All training failed - check data quality")
        return
    
    # 4. Continue with your model evaluation/prediction logic
    for timeframe, model in trained_models.items():
        logger.info(f"‚úÖ {timeframe} model ready with {model.num_trees()} trees")
Expected Resolution
After implementing this robust configuration, you should see:
‚Ä¢ Elimination of LightGBM warnings through proper parameter tuning for small datasets
‚Ä¢ Successful model training even with limited data through conservative parameters
‚Ä¢ Clear diagnostic information about why certain timeframes can't be trained
‚Ä¢ Automatic parameter adjustment based on your actual data volume
Key Parameter Changes
The most critical changes from default LightGBM parameters:
‚Ä¢ num_leaves: 8 (vs default 31) - Prevents overfitting on small datasets
‚Ä¢ max_depth: 4 (vs default -1) - Shallow trees for limited data
‚Ä¢ min_data_in_leaf: 5-10 - Ensures meaningful leaf nodes
‚Ä¢ min_gain_to_split: 0.01-0.1 - Requires meaningful improvements
‚Ä¢ Heavy regularization (lambda_l1, lambda_l2) to prevent overfitting
‚Ä¢ Early stopping to prevent training beyond useful point
This addresses the root cause of your warnings: insufficient data being forced into overly complex model parameters. The robust configuration will either train successfully with appropriate complexity or fail gracefully with clear diagnostic information about what data improvements are needed.

We will also need to file created called robust_lightgbm_config.py

Preventing and Handling LightGBM ‚ÄúHang‚Äù Situations
To ensure your forecasting pipeline never stalls indefinitely when LightGBM emits warnings or encounters pathological data conditions, implement both LightGBM-level callbacks and external watchdog mechanisms. Together, these will detect problematic training runs, abort them cleanly, and surface a clear error message.
1. LightGBM Callbacks and Built-In Safeguards
1.1 Early Stopping and Verbose Evaluation
‚Ä¢ Use early_stopping_rounds so training automatically halts when no improvement occurs for a specified number of rounds.

python
lgb.train(
    params,
    train_set,
    valid_sets=[valid_set],
    early_stopping_rounds=10,     # stop after 10 rounds without metric improvement
    verbose_eval=10               # print evaluation metrics every 10 iterations
)
1.2 Custom ‚ÄúNo Improvement‚Äù Callback
Define a callback that raises an exception when you detect repeated ‚Äúbest gain: -inf‚Äù warnings, ensuring control returns to your Python code immediately.

python
def stop_on_negative_gain(env):
    # env.best_score is None when no valid splits
    if env.best_score is None or env.best_score < 0:
        raise lgb.basic.LightGBMError("Aborting: no positive gain splits detected")
model = lgb.train(
    params,
    train_data,
    valid_sets=[valid_data],
    callbacks=[stop_on_negative_gain, lgb.early_stopping(10)]
)
1.3 Maximum Iteration Guard
Set a hard cap on num_iterations to prevent runaway loops:

python
params['num_iterations'] = 100      # don‚Äôt allow more than 100 boosting rounds
2. External Watchdog: Timeouts and Threading
2.1 Python Timeout Decorator
Wrap your training call in a function decorated to raise a TimeoutError if it exceeds a wall-clock limit.

python
import signal
class TimeoutException(Exception): pass
def timeout(seconds):
    def decorator(func):
        def _handle_timeout(signum, frame):
            raise TimeoutException(f"Training exceeded {seconds}s")
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, _handle_timeout)
            signal.alarm(seconds)
            try:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            finally:
                signal.alarm(0)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
@timeout(300)  # 5-minute limit
def run_training(...):
    return lgb.train(...)
2.2 concurrent.futures with Timeout
Launch LightGBM training in a separate process or thread and call .result(timeout=‚Ä¶):

python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, TimeoutError
def train_model():
    return lgb.train(...)
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:
    future = executor.submit(train_model)
    try:
        model = future.result(timeout=300)  # seconds
    except TimeoutError:
        future.cancel()
        raise RuntimeError("Training hung: canceled after timeout")
3. Catching Other Hang Scenarios
‚Ä¢ Custom Feature-Engineering Loops
Wrap any manual loops (e.g., multi-timeframe feature merges) in the same timeout or watchdog to prevent infinite loops on malformed data.
‚Ä¢ Deadlocks in Data I/O
Use nonblocking file reads, and catch OSError/IOError with timeouts if loading CSVs stalls.
‚Ä¢ Memory or CPU Starvation
Monitor system metrics and abort training if memory use exceeds a threshold.
4. Unified Error Handling in Your Pipeline
Integrate these safeguards into your enhanced_lightgbm_training_pipeline. For example:

python
def safe_train(...):
    try:
        model = run_training_with_timeout(...)  # uses @timeout or futures
        return model
    except (TimeoutException, lgb.basic.LightGBMError) as e:
        logger.error(f"Training aborted: {e}")
        return None
Summary
By combining LightGBM‚Äôs early stopping, a custom callback to abort on ‚Äúno gain,‚Äù and an external timeout/watchdog, your pipeline will:
‚Ä¢ Detect and stop stalled training runs promptly
‚Ä¢ Provide a clear, actionable error message (e.g., ‚ÄúAborting: no positive gain splits detected‚Äù or ‚ÄúTraining exceeded 300 s‚Äù)
‚Ä¢ Safely recover control and prevent hung processes
Implement these three layers of protection to ensure robust, self-healing model training.
