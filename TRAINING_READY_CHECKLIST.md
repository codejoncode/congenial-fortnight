- **All files have proper schema with 'date' column**

### âœ… 2. Feature Generation
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Total Features:** 346 (after variance filtering from 873)
- **Fundamental Features:** 34 âœ…
- **H4 Features:** 48
- **Weekly Features:** 48
- **Other Technical:** 216
- **Target Balance:** 50.6% (perfectly balanced)

### âœ… 3. Training Configuration
- **Status:** PASSED
- **num_iterations:** 1000 (updated from 100)
- **early_stopping_round:** 50 (updated from 10)
- **num_leaves:** 31 (updated from 8)
- **max_depth:** 8 (updated from 4)
- **learning_rate:** 0.03 (updated from 0.05)
- **max_bin:** 255 (updated from 64)
- **Configuration appropriate for 346 features Ã— 6,695 samples**

### âœ… 4. Signal Evaluation
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Method:** `evaluate_signal_features()` exists in forecasting.py (line 243)
- **Called by:** `scripts/automated_training.py` (line 278)
- **Output:** Will generate `{PAIR}_signal_evaluation.csv` with:
  - Feature name
  - Accuracy
  - Hit rate
  - Correlation with target

### âœ… 5. Models Directory
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Directory:** `models/` is empty and ready
- **No existing models to overwrite**

### âœ… 6. Training Time Estimate
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Estimated Time:** 77.2 minutes (full run)
- **With Early Stopping:** 23-54 minutes likely
- **Per Pair:** ~38 minutes (EURUSD), ~30 minutes (XAUUSD)
- **Much more appropriate than previous 2 minutes!**

## What Was Fixed

### Bug 1: Training Config Too Aggressive
**Problem:** Training was completing in 2 minutes (too fast!)
- `num_iterations: 100` â†’ Training stopped after 10-100 iterations
- `early_stopping_round: 10` â†’ Stopped as soon as 10 rounds without improvement

**Fix Applied:**
- Increased `num_iterations` to 1000
- Increased `early_stopping_round` to 50
- Increased model capacity (leaves, depth)
- Reduced learning rate for stability

**Result:** Training will now take 30-60 minutes (proper full run)

### Bug 2: Fundamental Features Were Zeros
**Problem:** Fundamental pipeline wasn't setting date as index
- All fundamental features became zeros after merge

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `.set_index('date')` to `load_all_series_as_df()` in fundamental_pipeline.py

**Result:** 0 â†’ 34 fundamental features now have real data

### Bug 3: Variance Calculation Crash
**Problem:** Non-numeric columns in variance calculation

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `select_dtypes(include=[np.number])` before variance calculation

**Result:** No more crashes, proper filtering

## Expected Outputs

### During Training
1. **Feature Engineering:** ~2 minutes per pair
2. **Model Training:** ~25-50 minutes per pair
3. **Signal Evaluation:** ~1 minute per pair
4. **Total:** ~30-60 minutes

### After Training
1. **Models:**
   - `models/EURUSD_model.txt` (LightGBM model)
   - `models/XAUUSD_model.txt` (LightGBM model)

2. **Signal Evaluation CSVs:**
   - `EURUSD_signal_evaluation.csv` (346 features Ã— metrics)

3. **Training Logs:**
   - Accuracy scores
   - Feature importance
   - Per-signal evaluation
