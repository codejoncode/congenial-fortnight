# Holloway Algorithm Implementation for Enterprise-Level Forex Trading

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the Holloway Algorithm, a sophisticated technical analysis indicator originally developed in PineScript for TradingView, now translated and enhanced for Python-based machine learning forex prediction systems.

## Algorithm Background

The Holloway Algorithm is a comprehensive trend analysis system that evaluates market direction through multiple moving average relationships and price action signals. It counts bullish and bearish signals across various timeframes and moving average combinations to determine market sentiment.

## Code Location & Execution

- **Module path:** `scripts/holloway_algorithm.py`
- **Primary class:** `CompleteHollowayAlgorithm`
- **Integration:** Instantiated once inside `HybridPriceForecastingEnsemble` (see `_calculate_holloway_features`) so every training run now sources counts from the full PineScript-equivalent implementation.
- **Standalone run:**

    ```powershell
    # from the repository root
    python scripts/holloway_algorithm.py
    ```

    The script will iterate through EURUSD and XAUUSD datasets (daily/weekly/4h), calculate the complete feature set, and export enriched CSVs (for example `data/EURUSD_daily_holloway_complete.csv`).

- **Fallback:** If the standalone module raises an exception during feature engineering, the ensemble automatically reverts to the legacy in-file computation to keep training resilient. Monitor logs for the warning `Complete Holloway Algorithm failed; falling back to legacy implementation.`

## Python Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Moving Average Calculations
The algorithm calculates Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for multiple periods:
- Periods: 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 50, 56, 100, 112, 200, 225

#### 2. Signal Generation
The algorithm generates signals based on:

**Price vs Moving Averages:**
- Close > EMA/SMA for bullish signals
- Close < EMA/SMA for bearish signals

**Moving Average Relationships:**
- EMA hierarchies (shorter > longer periods)
- SMA hierarchies
- EMA vs SMA crossovers and relationships

**Dynamic Signals:**
- Fresh breakouts above/below moving averages
- Moving average crossovers
- EMA/SMA relationship changes

#### 3. Count Aggregation
- `holloway_bull_count`: Sum of all bullish conditions
- `holloway_bear_count`: Sum of all bearish conditions
- Exponential moving averages of counts (span=27)

### Enhanced Features Added

#### 1. Advanced Signal Processing
```python
# Count differences and ratios
df['holloway_count_diff'] = df['holloway_bull_count'] - df['holloway_bear_count']
df['holloway_count_ratio'] = df['holloway_bull_count'] / (df['holloway_bear_count'] + 1)

# Rolling statistics
df['holloway_bull_max_20'] = df['holloway_bull_count'].rolling(20).max()
df['holloway_bull_min_20'] = df['holloway_bull_count'].rolling(20).min()
```

#### 2. Direction Change Detection
```python
# Cross signals when faster count crosses average
df['holloway_bull_cross_up'] = (df['holloway_bull_count'] > df['holloway_bull_avg']) & \
                               (df['holloway_bull_count'].shift(1) <= df['holloway_bull_avg'].shift(1))
df['holloway_bull_cross_down'] = (df['holloway_bull_count'] < df['holloway_bull_avg']) & \
                                 (df['holloway_bull_count'].shift(1) >= df['holloway_bull_avg'].shift(1))
```

#### 3. RSI Integration
- RSI 14-period calculation
- Overbought/Oversold levels (70/30)
- Bounce signals at resistance/support levels (51/49)

#### 4. Combined Signals
```python
df['holloway_bull_signal'] = df['holloway_bull_cross_up'] & ~df['rsi_overbought']
df['holloway_bear_signal'] = df['holloway_bear_cross_up'] & ~df['rsi_oversold']
```

#### 5. Diagnostic Outputs

When the dedicated module runs, it also publishes raw signal flags and day counters used for regime analysis:

```python
df['holloway_bull_signal_raw'] = df['bull_rise_signal']
df['holloway_bear_signal_raw'] = df['bear_rise_signal']
df['holloway_days_bull_over_avg'] = df['days_bull_count_over_average']
df['holloway_days_bull_under_avg'] = df['days_bull_count_under_average']
df['holloway_days_bear_over_avg'] = df['days_bear_count_over_average']
df['holloway_days_bear_under_avg'] = df['days_bear_count_under_average']
```

These columns are persisted alongside the traditional Holloway features so downstream analytics can differentiate between RSI-filtered trade signals and raw count events, as well as examine how long each side of the market has remained dominant.

## Integration with ML Pipeline

### Feature Engineering
The Holloway features are integrated into the main feature engineering pipeline:

```python
def _engineer_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # ... existing features ...
    
    # Add Holloway Algorithm features
    df = self._calculate_holloway_features(df)
    
    return df
```

### Model Training
Features are automatically included in the ensemble training process:
- LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees classifiers
- LSTM and BiLSTM deep learning models
- Meta-model stacking with LogisticRegression

## Separate Candle Size Prediction

### Architecture
Following the user's requirement to separate candle size prediction from directional prediction, a dedicated candle size model has been implemented.

#### Features (Candle Size Dependent)
- **ATR (Average True Range)**: 14, 20, 50 periods
- **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: 14, 20 periods
- **Pivot Points**: Central pivot, R1, S1, R2, S2
- **Candle Anatomy**: Range, body size, wick sizes, body ratios
- **Rolling Statistics**: SMA and STD of ranges and bodies

#### Target Variables
- `target_candle_range_1d`: Next day's High - Low
- `target_candle_body_1d`: Next day's |Close - Open|

#### Model Architecture
```python
# Separate Random Forest models for range and body prediction
range_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)
body_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)
```

## Lean Six Sigma Roadmap to 85% Directional Accuracy

### Define (Voice of the Business & CTQs)
- **Targets:** 85% directional accuracy per pair, ≥70% cross-pair ensemble, candle-shape MAE ≤ 0.002.
- **Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) Metrics:** Accuracy, profit factor, drawdown, candle-body MAE, deployment success rate.

- Capture data lineage for new H1/Monthly feeds plus fundamentals; automate schema validation.
- Extend diagnostics JSON to include Holloway count exposure, pattern hits, fundamental surprises.
- Establish defect rate dashboards (missed builds, failed backtests, GCP deploy errors).

### Analyze (Root Cause & Opportunity Identification)
- Run feature importance (SHAP/permutation) on current ensemble to quantify Holloway count impact.
- Perform gap study on ensemble misclassifications vs. Holloway count imbalance, missing multi-TF context, and candle-shape divergence.
- Cluster failures by regime (risk-on/off, macro events) to align upcoming fundamental features.
- Conduct impedance analysis on build pipeline to document blockers to Google Cloud deployment.

### Improve (Solution Design & Pilot)

    - Add harmonic (AB=CD, Gartley, Butterfly) and Elliott wave approximations.
    - Integrate macro drivers (rate differentials, PMI surprises, CFTC positioning, scheduled releases).
- **Model Architecture:**
    - Rebuild candle predictor as CNN/LSTM hybrid focused on OHLC sequences and Fibonacci-derived levels.
    - Train pair-specific models per timeframe using class-weighting or focal loss.
    - Replace equal-weight voting with meta-learner (stacked ensemble) using confidence scores + regime features.
- **Backtesting & Validation:**
    - Build slippage-aware simulator with walk-forward/rolling backtests; log P&L, hit rate, drawdown.
    - Feed backtest outcomes into meta-learner training and risk scoring.
- **Automation:**
    - Codify the above in reproducible pipelines (scripts/automation) with CI hooks.
    - Resolve GCP build failures by container hardening, dependency pinning, and Cloud Build testing.

### Control (Sustain & Monitor)
- Deploy monitoring service tracking directional accuracy, candle error, P&L, and Holloway signal health.
