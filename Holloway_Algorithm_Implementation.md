# Holloway Algorithm Implementation for Enterprise-Level Forex Trading

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the Holloway Algorithm, a sophisticated technical analysis indicator originally developed in PineScript for TradingView, now translated and enhanced for Python-based machine learning forex prediction systems.

## Algorithm Background

The Holloway Algorithm is a comprehensive trend analysis system that evaluates market direction through multiple moving average relationships and price action signals. It counts bullish and bearish signals across various timeframes and moving average combinations to determine market sentiment.

## Python Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Moving Average Calculations
The algorithm calculates Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for multiple periods:
- Periods: 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 50, 56, 100, 112, 200, 225

#### 2. Signal Generation
The algorithm generates signals based on:

**Price vs Moving Averages:**
- Close > EMA/SMA for bullish signals
- Close < EMA/SMA for bearish signals

**Moving Average Relationships:**
- EMA hierarchies (shorter > longer periods)
- SMA hierarchies
- EMA vs SMA crossovers and relationships

**Dynamic Signals:**
- Fresh breakouts above/below moving averages
- Moving average crossovers
- EMA/SMA relationship changes

#### 3. Count Aggregation
- `holloway_bull_count`: Sum of all bullish conditions
- `holloway_bear_count`: Sum of all bearish conditions
- Exponential moving averages of counts (span=27)

### Enhanced Features Added

#### 1. Advanced Signal Processing
```python
# Count differences and ratios
df['holloway_count_diff'] = df['holloway_bull_count'] - df['holloway_bear_count']
df['holloway_count_ratio'] = df['holloway_bull_count'] / (df['holloway_bear_count'] + 1)

# Rolling statistics
df['holloway_bull_max_20'] = df['holloway_bull_count'].rolling(20).max()
df['holloway_bull_min_20'] = df['holloway_bull_count'].rolling(20).min()
```

#### 2. Direction Change Detection
```python
# Cross signals when faster count crosses average
df['holloway_bull_cross_up'] = (df['holloway_bull_count'] > df['holloway_bull_avg']) & \
                               (df['holloway_bull_count'].shift(1) <= df['holloway_bull_avg'].shift(1))
df['holloway_bull_cross_down'] = (df['holloway_bull_count'] < df['holloway_bull_avg']) & \
                                 (df['holloway_bull_count'].shift(1) >= df['holloway_bull_avg'].shift(1))
```

#### 3. RSI Integration
- RSI 14-period calculation
- Overbought/Oversold levels (70/30)
- Bounce signals at resistance/support levels (51/49)

#### 4. Combined Signals
```python
df['holloway_bull_signal'] = df['holloway_bull_cross_up'] & ~df['rsi_overbought']
df['holloway_bear_signal'] = df['holloway_bear_cross_up'] & ~df['rsi_oversold']
```

## Integration with ML Pipeline

### Feature Engineering
The Holloway features are integrated into the main feature engineering pipeline:

```python
def _engineer_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # ... existing features ...
    
    # Add Holloway Algorithm features
    df = self._calculate_holloway_features(df)
    
    return df
```

### Model Training
Features are automatically included in the ensemble training process:
- LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees classifiers
- LSTM and BiLSTM deep learning models
- Meta-model stacking with LogisticRegression

## Separate Candle Size Prediction

### Architecture
Following the user's requirement to separate candle size prediction from directional prediction, a dedicated candle size model has been implemented.

#### Features (Candle Size Dependent)
- **ATR (Average True Range)**: 14, 20, 50 periods
- **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: 14, 20 periods
- **Pivot Points**: Central pivot, R1, S1, R2, S2
- **Candle Anatomy**: Range, body size, wick sizes, body ratios
- **Rolling Statistics**: SMA and STD of ranges and bodies

#### Target Variables
- `target_candle_range_1d`: Next day's High - Low
- `target_candle_body_1d`: Next day's |Close - Open|

#### Model Architecture
```python
# Separate Random Forest models for range and body prediction
range_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)
body_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)
```

## Enterprise-Level Enhancements

- **MAPE**: Percentage accuracy for size predictions

## Usage Examples

### Training Directional Model
```python
ensemble = HybridPriceForecastingEnsemble('EURUSD')
metrics = ensemble.train_full_ensemble()
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']:.4f}")
```

### Training Candle Size Model
```python
candle_metrics = ensemble.train_candle_size_model()
print(f"Range MAE: {candle_metrics['candle_range_mae']:.6f}")
```

### Feature Analysis
```python
features = ensemble._engineer_features(price_data)
holloway_cols = [col for col in features.columns if 'holloway' in col]
print(f"Holloway features: {len(holloway_cols)}")
