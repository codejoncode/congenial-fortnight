# Holloway Algorithm Implementation for Enterprise-Level Forex Trading

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the Holloway Algorithm, a sophisticated technical analysis indicator originally developed in PineScript for TradingView, now translated and enhanced for Python-based machine learning forex prediction systems.

> **Release Note (October 2025):** `scripts/holloway_algorithm.py` now delivers a line-for-line PineScript parity build with all 400+ conditions, weighted scoring, smoothing stacks, critical level monitoring, and trend-failure diagnostics restored. The sections below outline every component incorporated in this final pass.

## Algorithm Background

The Holloway Algorithm is a comprehensive trend analysis system that evaluates market direction through multiple moving average relationships and price action signals. It counts bullish and bearish signals across various timeframes and moving average combinations to determine market sentiment.

## Code Location & Execution

- **Module path:** `scripts/holloway_algorithm.py`
- **Primary class:** `CompleteHollowayAlgorithm`
- **Integration:** Instantiated once inside `HybridPriceForecastingEnsemble` (see `_calculate_holloway_features`) so every training run now sources counts from the full PineScript-equivalent implementation.
- **Standalone run:**

    ```powershell
    # from the repository root
    python scripts/holloway_algorithm.py
    ```

    The script will iterate through EURUSD and XAUUSD datasets (daily/weekly/4h), calculate the complete feature set, and export enriched CSVs (for example `data/EURUSD_daily_holloway_complete.csv`).

- **Fallback:** If the standalone module raises an exception during feature engineering, the ensemble automatically reverts to the legacy in-file computation to keep training resilient. Monitor logs for the warning `Complete Holloway Algorithm failed; falling back to legacy implementation.`

## Python Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Moving Average Calculations
The algorithm calculates Exponential (EMA), Simple (SMA), Hull (HMA), and Smoothed (RMA) moving averages for multiple periods:
- Periods: 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 50, 56, 100, 112, 200, 225

#### 2. Signal Generation
The algorithm generates signals based on:

**Price vs Moving Averages:**
- Close > EMA/SMA for bullish signals
- Close < EMA/SMA for bearish signals

**Moving Average Relationships:**
- EMA hierarchies (shorter > longer periods)
- SMA hierarchies
- EMA vs SMA crossovers and relationships (including the restored `exp7 < sim7` and counterpart conditions)

**Dynamic Signals:**
- Fresh breakouts above/below moving averages
- Moving average crossovers
- EMA/SMA relationship changes

#### 3. Exact Weighted Historical Scoring
- **Point ladder:** `[3.0, 2.7, 2.4, 2.1, 1.8, 1.5, 1.2, 0.9, 0.6]` is applied to current and prior observations, reproducing the PineScript mechanics (`bullCount := bullSar ? bullCount + 3 : bullCount`).
- `holloway_bull_count` and `holloway_bear_count` sum the weighted bullish/bearish conditions, ensuring the historical contribution decays exactly as designed.
- `holloway_count_diff` and `holloway_count_ratio` are derived from these weighted totals to quantify directional skew.

#### 4. Multi-Average Smoothing Stack
- `sma_bull_count`, `ema_bull_count`, `hma_bull_count`, and `rma_bull_count` (and bear counterparts) are aggregated into `bully` and `beary` via `(sma + ema + hma + rma) / 4`.
- The smoothing ensemble recreates the PineScript “yellow line” context used for trend fatigue detection.
- Exponential moving averages of the counts (span=27) deliver lag-aware confirmation layers and feed into downstream crossover checks.

### Enhanced Features Added

#### 1. Advanced Signal Processing
```python
# Count differences and ratios
df['holloway_count_diff'] = df['holloway_bull_count'] - df['holloway_bear_count']
df['holloway_count_ratio'] = df['holloway_bull_count'] / (df['holloway_bear_count'] + 1)

# Rolling statistics
df['holloway_bull_max_20'] = df['holloway_bull_count'].rolling(20).max()
df['holloway_bull_min_20'] = df['holloway_bull_count'].rolling(20).min()
```

#### 2. Direction Change Detection
```python
# Cross signals when faster count crosses average
df['holloway_bull_cross_up'] = (df['holloway_bull_count'] > df['holloway_bull_avg']) & \
                               (df['holloway_bull_count'].shift(1) <= df['holloway_bull_avg'].shift(1))
df['holloway_bull_cross_down'] = (df['holloway_bull_count'] < df['holloway_bull_avg']) & \
                                 (df['holloway_bull_count'].shift(1) >= df['holloway_bull_avg'].shift(1))
```

#### 3. Critical Level Tracking
- **Upper Threshold (95+):** Consecutive counts above 95 flag exhaustion zones; alerts fire when the streak terminates, matching “once it goes over it doesn’t last for long.”
- **Lower Threshold (<12):** Rare dips below 12 capture capitulation. Rebound logic highlights the reversal impulse when the smoothed counts exit this band.
- **Streak Metrics:** Duration fields (`holloway_days_bull_over_avg`, `holloway_days_bear_under_avg`, etc.) quantify how long dominance persists above/below key averages.

#### 4. RSI Integration
- RSI 14-period calculation
- Overbought/Oversold levels (70/30)
- Bounce signals at resistance/support levels (51/49)

#### 5. Combined Signals
```python
df['holloway_bull_signal'] = df['holloway_bull_cross_up'] & ~df['rsi_overbought']
df['holloway_bear_signal'] = df['holloway_bear_cross_up'] & ~df['rsi_oversold']
```

#### 6. Double-Failure & Trend Weakness Diagnostics
- **Double Failure Pattern:** Detects consecutive failed attempts to establish higher highs (or lower lows) in the weighted counts, a weakness signature requested by trading operations.
- **Yellow-Line Slowdown:** Implements the PineScript rules (`bear_slowing = beary[0] < beary[1] < beary[2] < beary[3] and beary > bully`) to spotlight momentum fatigue for both bull and bear regimes.
- **Strength Confirmation:** Explicit bools flag when fast counts cross above/below smoothed stacks (“count going over slower = strength”).

#### 7. Diagnostic Outputs

When the dedicated module runs, it also publishes raw signal flags and day counters used for regime analysis:

```python
df['holloway_bull_signal_raw'] = df['bull_rise_signal']
df['holloway_bear_signal_raw'] = df['bear_rise_signal']
df['holloway_days_bull_over_avg'] = df['days_bull_count_over_average']
df['holloway_days_bull_under_avg'] = df['days_bull_count_under_average']
df['holloway_days_bear_over_avg'] = df['days_bear_count_over_average']
df['holloway_days_bear_under_avg'] = df['days_bear_count_under_average']
```

These columns are persisted alongside the traditional Holloway features so downstream analytics can differentiate between RSI-filtered trade signals and raw count events, as well as examine how long each side of the market has remained dominant.

## Integration with ML Pipeline

### Feature Engineering
The Holloway features are integrated into the main feature engineering pipeline:

```python
def _engineer_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # ... existing features ...
    
    # Add Holloway Algorithm features
    df = self._calculate_holloway_features(df)
    
    return df
```

### Model Training
Features are automatically included in the ensemble training process:
- LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees classifiers
- LSTM and BiLSTM deep learning models
- Meta-model stacking with LogisticRegression

## Separate Candle Size Prediction

### Architecture
Following the user's requirement to separate candle size prediction from directional prediction, a dedicated candle size model has been implemented.

#### Features (Candle Size Dependent)
- **ATR (Average True Range)**: 14, 20, 50 periods
- **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: 14, 20 periods
- **Pivot Points**: Central pivot, R1, S1, R2, S2
- **Candle Anatomy**: Range, body size, wick sizes, body ratios
- **Rolling Statistics**: SMA and STD of ranges and bodies

#### Target Variables
- `target_candle_range_1d`: Next day's High - Low
- `target_candle_body_1d`: Next day's |Close - Open|

#### Model Architecture
```python
# Separate Random Forest models for range and body prediction
range_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)
body_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)
```

### Candle Size Model (Regression)
- **Range MAE**: Predicts next day's volatility range
- **Body MAE**: Predicts next day's price movement magnitude
- **MAPE**: Percentage accuracy for size predictions

## Usage Examples

### Training Directional Model
```python
ensemble = HybridPriceForecastingEnsemble('EURUSD')
metrics = ensemble.train_full_ensemble()
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']:.4f}")
```

### Training Candle Size Model
```python
candle_metrics = ensemble.train_candle_size_model()
print(f"Range MAE: {candle_metrics['candle_range_mae']:.6f}")
```

### Feature Analysis
```python
features = ensemble._engineer_features(price_data)
holloway_cols = [col for col in features.columns if 'holloway' in col]
print(f"Holloway features: {len(holloway_cols)}")
```

### Multi-Timeframe Coverage
```python
algorithm = CompleteHollowayAlgorithm()
for timeframe in ["1h", "4h", "1d", "1w"]:
    run = algorithm.calculate_complete_holloway_algorithm(pair="EURUSD", timeframe=timeframe)
    print(timeframe, run["summary"]["dominant_trend"], run["summary"]["critical_level_flags"])
```

- Each timeframe executes the same PineScript-equivalent rules, enabling cross-timeframe correlation studies and early momentum detection on faster charts.
- Critical level flags, double-failure detection, and strength confirmation booleans are emitted regardless of timeframe to keep analytics uniform.
