# Training Readiness Summary

## Overview
Based on a deep analysis of the repository, here's the current state of the forecasting and training system:

## âœ… What's Working

### Data Schema
- Your price files have the correct unified schema (id, timestamp, time, open, high, low, close, volume, spread)
- CSV normalization helpers are in place to handle MetaTrader and other formats
- Data validation passes for essential files (EURUSD_H1.csv, XAUUSD_H1.csv, etc.)

### Model Pipeline
- Robust LightGBM training pipeline with validation is implemented
- Feature pruning utilities are integrated
- Schema and prune reporting is functional
- Automated training orchestration handles per-pair runs

### Feature Engineering
- Holloway algorithm and multi-timeframe features are integrated
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, ATR, etc.) are implemented
- Cross-pair correlation features are available
- Fundamental data integration is set up (FRED API client)

### Data Volume
- Substantial historical data available (6000+ rows for daily consolidated data)
- Intraday (H1) and monthly data loaded successfully
- Data spans from 2000-01-03 to 2025-09-29

## ðŸ”§ Critical Fixes Needed

### FRED API Key Loading
- Environment variables from `.env` are not automatically loaded in the automated training process
- Need to add environment loading patch to `automated_training.py` to ensure `FRED_API_KEY` is available
- Current workaround: manually load `.env` in the process (works for diagnostics but not ideal for production)

### Dry-Run Sample Size
- Default `--dry-iterations 10` results in only 50 samples, triggering the pipeline's critical data quality check
- Need to increase to `--dry-iterations 50+` to provide sufficient samples for meaningful training simulation

### Feature Verification
- Default NA threshold of 0.5 is aggressive; use `--na-threshold 0.3` for less pruning during testing
- Ensure fundamentals attach as `fund_*` columns when FRED key is available

## ðŸš€ Ready-to-Execute Plan

### 1. Apply Environment Fix
Add code to `scripts/automated_training.py` to load `.env` variables at startup:

```python
# Add near the top of main() or __init__
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Load .env file if present
env_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / '.env'
if env_path.exists():
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv(env_path)
```

### 2. Run Diagnostic
Create and run `training_diagnostic.py` to verify:
- Forecasting class instantiation
- Feature engineering produces non-empty DataFrame
- Fundamentals attach when FRED key is available
- Sample command: `python training_diagnostic.py`

### 3. Test Dry-Run
Run with adjusted parameters:
```bash
python -m scripts.automated_training --pairs EURUSD --dry-run --dry-iterations 50 --na-threshold 0.3
```

### 4. Full Training
Execute complete training pipeline:
```bash
python -m scripts.automated_training --pairs EURUSD XAUUSD --target 0.75
```

## Current Status
- Code architecture is solid and complete
- Data loading and feature engineering work
- Training pipeline is robust with safety checks
- Main blockers are environmental (key loading) and configuration (sample sizes)

## Next Steps
1. Apply the environment loading fix
2. Run diagnostic to confirm feature engineering
3. Test dry-run with sufficient samples
4. Execute full training for both pairs

You're very close to having a fully functional training system. The main blockers are environmental and configuration-related, not architectural.
