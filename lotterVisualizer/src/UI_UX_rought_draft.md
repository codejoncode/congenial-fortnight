This is a rought draft of what the single page app could look like to display the data. 
Just have components within components  and then   be able to toggle sections of the page so i can see other data avaialbe. 

########################################################################################

	Header title logic  and likely some filter tabs to make it easy to navigate

##################################################    | This is for filter selection 
Number 1-70  and a clever way to show how many times  | add filter select filter 
they have hit at a life time  and how many draws its  | say i want to know the 
been since they hit.                                  |
##################################################    |
slide able should be able to slide button click       |
to see  last digits patterns first digit patterns     |
etc division  pairs  triples
also the groups of 35 i am supposed to see grids
with every number in these 10 grids show up 5 times
5 x 70 = 350  35 x 10 the 35 numbers are  in a 5 x 7 cell
where after 14 draws i want to know how often a number in a 
grid where there hasn't been a hit in the last 14 draws 
for that row or column is then used to predict future outcomes
we should be able to see its success rate

##############################################  |  pairs or triples or other filters
draws historically starting with latest draw on |  division digit sums shows analysis 
top. 						|  of what hit as compared to the draw 
you can use a slider vertical to only show the  | line by line also amount of draws its 
last 50 draws or so 				| has been since it was hit

Show me the combinations left over to select with their scores here based on my filters or  top 10 numbers based on scores from algorithm.
