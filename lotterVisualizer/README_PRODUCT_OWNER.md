Absolutely, J — here’s your Product Owner README for the ApexScoop Picks system. This version is written to guide your team, stakeholders, and contributors through the vision, functionality, and implementation priorities of the project. It’s not just technical—it’s strategic, teachable, and aligned with your modular, explainable culture.

📊 Picks
Predictive Combo Intelligence for Lottery Analytics
Built for speed, transparency, and teachability.

🧭 Product Vision
ApexScoop Picks is a real-time, explainable decision-support engine for lottery combo selection. It transforms raw draw history into actionable, auditable insights—ranking combinations by historical lift, recurrence behavior, regime alignment, and momentum. Every pick is scored, visualized, and justified.
This system is not just a picker—it’s a teachable overlay, a training tool, and a cultural artifact. It empowers teams to learn, audit, and evolve their prediction strategies with clarity and confidence.

🎯 Core Goals
• 	Speed: Generate and score millions of combos in milliseconds using compiled filters and early-exit logic.
• 	Transparency: Every combo comes with a full audit trail—why it passed, how it performed, and what it’s made of.
• 	Teachability: All logic is modular, explainable, and ready to be codified into onboarding overlays.
• 	Predictive Power: Combos are ranked not just by past performance, but by trend and freshness.
• 	Visual Intelligence: Heatmaps and dashboards surface the strongest picks and patterns at a glance.

🧩 Key Features
🔍 Explain Mode
Every combo is annotated with:
• 	Keys matched
• 	Sum corridor
• 	Parity signature
• 	Regime alignment
• 	Historical hit rate
• 	Residue size
• 	Lift vs baseline
• 	Recurrence pass/fail with reasons
📈 Lift & Baseline
Quantifies how a combo performs relative to the average under the same filter set.
🔁 Recurrence Analysis
Tracks how often types (e.g. last digit 3, sum band 208–216) repeat or rebound:
• 	P(hit next  hit now)
• 	P(hit next  miss now)
• 	Avg gap, max gap, streak %
⚡ Compiled Filter Engine
Combines all constraints into a single predicate function:
• 	Keys
• 	Sum
• 	Parity
• 	Regime
• 	Recurrence
• 	Early-exit backtracking avoids building invalid combos
🧠 Confidence Index
Blends:
• 	Lift score
• 	Recurrence strength
• 	Regime alignment
→ Scaled to 0–100
🔥 Heat Score
Adds:
• 	Momentum bonus/penalty (confidence trend over last N draws)
• 	Freshness multiplier (based on draws-out)
→ Final score reflects trend + recency + strength
🗺️ Confidence Heatmap
Visualizes:
• 	X = Total Draw Points
• 	Y = Heat Score
• 	Color = Lift %
• 	Size = Avg Residue
→ Spot clusters, trends, and outliers instantly
📊 Heat Score Dashboard
One-stop view:
• 	Ranked combos
• 	Momentum trails
• 	Recurrence breakdowns
• 	Explain Mode reasons
• 	Filters: Heat, Points, Regime, Recurrence, Momentum
📘 Auto-Playbook Mode
Generates a ready-to-play shortlist based on strike-zone rules:
• 	Heat ≥ X
• 	Points ≥ Y
• 	Regime match
• 	Positive momentum
• 	Recurrence pass
→ Saves snapshot, exports play sheet, locks picks

🛠️ Implementation Priorities
Phase 1: Core Engine
• 	[x] Explain Mode logic

• 	[x] Compiled filter predicate
• 	[x] Early-exit generator
Phase 2: Scoring & Momentum
• 	[x] Confidence Index
• 	[x] Momentum tracking
• 	[x] Freshness weighting
• 	[x] Heat Score calculation
Phase 3: Visualization
• 	[x] Heatmap with trails
• 	[x] Dashboard table
• 	[x] Combo detail panel
• 	[x] Filters and sort toggles
Phase 4: Playbook Automation
• 	[ ] Strike-zone config
• 	[ ] Auto-shortlist generator
• 	[ ] Export and lock actions
• 	[ ] Audit trail storage

🧪 Testing Strategy
• 	✅ Snapshot tests for Explain Mode
• 	✅ Property tests for recurrence logic
• 	✅ Performance benchmarks for generator
• 	✅ UI tests for dashboard filters and sorting
• 	✅ Logging with trace IDs for auditability

🧠 Cultural Overlay
This system reflects ApexScoop’s ethos:
• 	Modular logic → every rule is teachable and swappable
• 	Explainable filters → no black boxes
• 	Visual onboarding → every dashboard doubles as a training tool
• 	Symbolic insight → regime, recurrence, and momentum are metaphors for rhythm and readiness

Repo Structure (Proposed)
/src
  /core        → logic modules (explain, recurrence, scoring)
  /data        → draw history, type definitions
  /ui          → dashboard, heatmap, controls
  /utils       → math, formatting
  index.tsx    → app entry
README.md      → this file

🧭 Next Steps
• 	[ ] Finalize draw history adapter
• 	[ ] Codify recurrence types registry
• 	[ ] Build regime detector module
• 	[ ] Wire Auto-Playbook export
• 	[ ] Add onboarding overlay for dashboard
🧑‍💼 Product Owner Notes
• 	Every feature must be auditable, teachable, and scalable.
• 	All logic should be codified into overlays for onboarding and training.
• 	UI must support explain mode, filter transparency, and momentum visualization.
• 	Performance must support real-time generation for millions of combos.
• 	All scoring must be self-validating and explainable to non-technical users.
