# Reports Format

This document describes the JSON reports generated by the pipeline:

- `output/schema_report_<PAIR>.json` — per-pair schema report generated before training.
  - Fields include: pair, rows, cols, fund_cols, cross_pair_cols, sample_columns, na_counts, na_pct, dtypes, variance, zero_counts, basic_stats

- `output/prune_report_<PAIR>.json` — results of automatic feature pruning.
  - Fields include: dropped_na_pct, dropped_zero_variance, initial_cols, final_cols, n_initial_cols, n_final_cols

These reports are primarily used for auditability and CI checks. Save them as artifacts in CI runs to examine how features changed between runs.
