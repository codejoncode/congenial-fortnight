**Commit:** `0fb29d9` - "test: Enhance US Forex Rules tests (45/49 passing, 73% coverage)"

**Pass Rate:** 92% (45/49 tests passing)

**Remaining Issues:** 4 tests fail because `engine.close_position()` returns PaperTrade object instead of dict. Minor refactoring needed.

---

### 3. API Views Tests ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Achievement:** Tests written, mocking infrastructure needed

**Tests Created:** 20 additional tests
- Query parameter filtering (pair, status, signal_type, days)
- Error handling (closed trades, missing fields)
- Performance metrics with custom parameters
- Price API endpoint validation (3 tests)
- MT5 Bridge API endpoints (2 tests)
- PerformanceMetrics ViewSet filtering (4 tests)

**Status:** Tests written but require mocking:
- `PaperTradingEngine` - Complex business logic
- `DataAggregator` - Price fetching
- `MT5EasyBridge` - MT5 integration

**Files:**
- ✅ `paper_trading/tests/test_views.py` (220 lines enhanced)
- ⏸️ Coverage unchanged at 53% (mocks needed)

**Commit:** `979eb7b` - "test: Add enhanced API views tests"

**Recommendation:** Refactor views to use dependency injection for better testability, or implement comprehensive mock strategy.

---

### 4. MT5 Bridge Tests ⏭️ DEFERRED

**Status:** Not started - deferred to next phase

**Reason:** MT5 Bridge has complex external dependencies and would require extensive mocking. Given time constraints and the excellent progress on other components, this was strategically deferred.

**Plan:** Will be addressed in Phase 2.3 or as standalone task with proper MT5 simulation framework.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Highlights

### WebSocket Testing Pattern
```python
async def test_websocket_connect(self):
    communicator = WebsocketCommunicator(
        TradingWebSocketConsumer.as_asgi(), 
        "/ws/trading/"
    )
    connected, _ = await communicator.connect()
    assert connected == True
    
    response = await communicator.receive_json_from()
    assert response['type'] == 'connection'
    
    await communicator.disconnect()
```

### US Forex Rules Pattern
```python
def test_position_sizing_medium_account(self, engine):
    result = engine.calculate_position_size(
        account_balance=Decimal('10000'),
        risk_percent=Decimal('2'),
        stop_loss_pips=50,
        symbol='EURUSD'
    )
    
    assert result['risk_amount'] == Decimal('200.00')
    assert abs(result['lot_size'] - Decimal('0.40')) < Decimal('0.01')
```

### Dependencies Fixed
```bash
# requirements.txt updates
pytest==7.4.3           # Fixed version conflict
pytest-django==4.7.0    # Django test integration
pytest-asyncio==0.21.2  # Async test support
channels==4.0.0         # WebSocket support
channels-redis==4.2.0   # Channel layer
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Start with Isolated Components**
   - WebSocket consumers had no external dependencies
   - Perfect first target - achieved 79% coverage quickly
   - Built confidence and momentum

2. **Pure Logic is Easy to Test**
   - US Forex Rules are pure calculations
   - No database dependencies for most functions
   - Achieved 73% coverage with 27 tests

3. **Test Infrastructure Matters**
   - Good `conftest.py` setup saved hours
   - Channel layer configuration was crucial
   - Proper fixtures make tests maintainable

4. **Parametrized Tests Scale Well**
   - Single test covers multiple account sizes
   - Reduces code duplication
   - Makes patterns obvious

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Complex Dependencies**
   - Views tightly coupled to business logic
   - Need dependency injection or comprehensive mocks
   - Integration testing vs unit testing tradeoffs

2. **Field Name Mismatches**
   - Database used `pair` not `symbol`
   - Model had `order_type` not `signal_type`
   - Fixed with proper aliasing in model `__init__`

3. **Return Type Assumptions**
   - Engine methods returned objects, not dicts
   - Tests expected dict format
   - Need to standardize return types
