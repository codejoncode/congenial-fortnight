  - Filter by active/channels/signal_filter
  - Fieldsets for contact methods, channels, filters, triggers
  
✓ NotificationLogAdmin
  - Delivery log viewer
  - Filter by status/type/method
  - Date hierarchy for time-based browsing
  - Retry failed notifications action
```

### 4. Database Migrations
**File:** `paper_trading/migrations/0006_notificationpreferences_notificationlog.py`

```python
✓ Created notification_preferences table
✓ Created notification_log table
✓ Added indexes for performance
✓ Migration applied successfully
```
