Cost:
  - Free tier covers most personal usage
  - ~$5-10/month for moderate usage
  - Cloud SQL: $7/month (db-f1-micro)
```

**Option B: Local VM (Docker)**
```yaml
Pros:
  - Full control
  - No cloud costs
  - Always-on
  - Low latency
  
Cons:
  - Requires home server/VM
  - You manage updates/backups
  - Need dynamic DNS for remote access
  
Cost:
  - $0 (uses your hardware)
  - Electricity costs
```

**Option C: Hybrid (BEST)**
```yaml
Setup:
  - Google Cloud Run for web interface
  - Local VM for trading engine
  - WebSocket/API connection between them
  
Benefits:
  - Secure web access anywhere
  - Trading engine runs locally
  - Free tier for frontend
  - Low latency for trades
```

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] Create Dockerfile
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Create cloudbuild.yaml (for GCP)
