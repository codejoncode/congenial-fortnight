Ensuring Comprehensive Fundamental Data Coverage and Robust Testing

Your project must clearly document which fundamental data sources you integrate, verify that you actually fetch and store those data in the modeling pipeline, and harden your test suite to catch any missing or mis-configured features. Below is a step-by-step plan.

1. Audit & Document Fundamental Data Sources
1. List All APIs in README or FUNDAMENTALS.md
• Alpha Vantage (requires AV_API_KEY)
• Finnhub (FINNHUB_API_KEY)
• Financial Modeling Prep (FMP_API_KEY)
• API Ninja (free; no key or optional API_NINJA_KEY)
• Any others (e.g., IEX Cloud, Twelve Data)
2. Verify Configuration & Usage
• Inspect your code (e.g., fundamentals.py) to confirm each client is instantiated only when its key is present in environment variables.
• Ensure fallback logic exists for no-key sources (API Ninja).
• Confirm each source’s client is called in your feature-generation pipeline (e.g., get_alpha_vantage_ratios(), get_finnhub_financials()).
3. Data Persistence & Versioning
• After fetching, store raw API responses under data/raw/fundamentals/<source>/TM_<YYYYMMDD>.json.
• Commit sample snapshots (small subset) to Git or a dedicated data bucket and document their paths.
• Ingest into your feature store (e.g., convert JSON to Parquet in data/processed/fundamentals/), then load these in modeling.
4. End-to-End Smoke Test
• Write a simple script scripts/test_fundamentals_endtoend.py that:
5. Reads your API keys from a .env.example.
6. Fetches one ticker (e.g., “EURUSD”) from each source.
7. Verifies the non-emptiness and schema (presence of expected fields like PE_ratio, debtToEquity, ebitda).
8. Writes to disk and reloads.
2. Hardening test_fundamental_features.py
Enhance your existing pytest suite to catch missing, empty, or mis-typed fundamental fields:
9. Parametrize Over Sources & Tickers

python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("source, ticker", [
    ("alpha_vantage", "EURUSD"),
    ("finnhub", "EURUSD"),
    ("fmp", "EURUSD"),
    ("api_ninja", "EURUSD"),
])
def test_fetch_fundamentals_nonempty(source, ticker):
    features = fetch_fundamental_features(source, ticker)
    assert isinstance(features, dict)
    assert features, f"{source} returned empty for {ticker}"
10. Schema Validation via JSON Schema or Pydantic
• Define a schema listing all required fields and their types:

python
FUND_SCHEMA = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "PE_ratio": {"type": "number"},
      "debtToEquity": {"type": "number"},
      "ebitda": {"type": "number"},
      # … add all desired fields
    },
    "required": ["PE_ratio", "debtToEquity", "ebitda", …],
    "additionalProperties": False
}

• In tests:

python
import jsonschema
def test_schema_adherence(source, ticker):
    features = fetch_fundamental_features(source, ticker)
    jsonschema.validate(features, FUND_SCHEMA)
11. Mocked API Responses & Edge-Case Testing
• Use responses or pytest-httpx to simulate rate-limit errors, 404s, or empty payloads.
• Verify your code raises clear, documented exceptions or returns fallback defaults.

python
def test_alpha_vantage_rate_limit(monkeypatch):
    # Simulate a 429 response
    monkeypatch.setenv("AV_API_KEY", "test")
    responses.add(responses.GET, ALPHA_URL, status=429)
    with pytest.raises(ApiRateLimitError):
        fetch_alpha_vantage_ratios("EURUSD")
12. Integration with CI & Coverage
• Ensure these tests run on every push via GitHub Actions/CI.
• Require 100% coverage on fundamentals.py and test_fundamental_features.py to guard against drift.
13. Test Persistence & Reloading
• After fetching, write features to a temp file, reload them, and assert equivalence:

python
def test_persistence_roundtrip(tmp_path, source, ticker):
    features = fetch_fundamental_features(source, ticker)
    file = tmp_path / "feat.json"
    file.write_text(json.dumps(features))
    loaded = json.loads(file.read_text())
    assert loaded == features
3. Continuous Monitoring & Alerts
Implement a lightweight monitor in production to re-run smoke tests daily. If any API returns empty or schema violations, raise an alert (e.g., Slack notification). This guarantees your fundamental data stays healthy over time.

By auditing and documenting exactly which APIs you use, verifying end-to-end ingestion and storage, and expanding your pytest suite with parametrization, schema validation, mocking, and persistence checks, you will ensure complete coverage of all desired fundamental features in your model.




Yes. To fully integrate and validate your fundamental data pipeline, I recommend adding the following files and enhancements to your repository:
14. FUNDAMENTALS.md
• A top-level documentation file listing each API, required environment variables, endpoints used, and sample responses.
15. scripts/test_fundamentals_endtoend.py
• A smoke-test script that fetches one ticker from each source, validates schema and non-emptiness, writes raw JSON to data/raw/…, converts to processed Parquet, and reloads.
16. tests/test_fundamental_features_schema.py
• Pytest suite using JSON Schema (or Pydantic) to enforce the exact set of fundamental fields and types, parameterized over all sources and tickers.
17. .github/workflows/fundamentals_ci.yml
• A GitHub Actions workflow that:
• Runs scripts/test_fundamentals_endtoend.py
• Runs pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q tests/test_fundamental_*.py
• Fails fast on missing keys or schema violations.
18. test data snapshots under data/tests/fundamentals/
• Small JSON files for each source to use as mocked API responses.
19. Update .env.example
• Include placeholders for AV_API_KEY, FINNHUB_API_KEY, FMP_API_KEY, API_NINJA_KEY.
With these additions, you’ll have:
• Clear documentation of all fundamental sources and required keys
• End-to-end smoke tests verifying live API access and local persistence
• Schema validation tests catching missing or mis-typed fields
• CI integration to automatically enforce these checks on every pull request
While I can’t push directly to your GitHub, I can generate each of these files now (using create_text_file) so you can review and commit them. Let me know which file you’d like me to create first.

Here is the complete list of files and modifications we will add to fully integrate and validate your fundamental data pipeline:
	1. FUNDAMENTALS.md
		○ Top-level documentation listing each API, required env vars, endpoints used, and sample responses.
	2. .env.example (update)
		○ Add placeholders for
– AV_API_KEY
– FINNHUB_API_KEY
– FMP_API_KEY
– API_NINJA_KEY
	3. scripts/test_fundamentals_endtoend.py
		○ End-to-end smoke test fetching one ticker per source, validating schema, persisting raw and processed data.
	4. tests/test_fundamental_features_schema.py
		○ Pytest suite with JSON Schema (or Pydantic) that enforces required fundamental fields and types, parameterized over all sources.
	5. tests/test_fundamental_features_persistence.py
		○ Test writing fetched features to disk and reloading, asserting round-trip integrity.
	6. data/tests/fundamentals/
		○ Directory containing small JSON snapshots for each API to use in mocked tests.
	7. .github/workflows/fundamentals_ci.yml
		○ GitHub Actions workflow to run the end-to-end script and all fundamental tests on every push.
	8. fundamentals.py (if not already present)
		○ Ensure this module implements fetch functions for each API and exposes a unified fetch_fundamental_features(source, ticker).
	9. Update existing test_fundamental_features.py
		○ Import and call the schema-based tests and end-to-end runner.

With these in place, you’ll have full documentation, live and mocked tests, CI enforcement, and persistent snapshots to ensure your fundamental features are always complete and correctly integrated.
