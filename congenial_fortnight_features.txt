Is there a recommend combination for the best accuracy
Is there a recommend combination for the best accuracy
For the best accuracy in price prediction and forecasting, the current state-of-the-art approach typically involves combining classical statistical methods with modern machine learning and deep learning models. This hybrid approach leverages strengths from each method to improve robustness and predictive power.
Recommended Combination for Best Accuracy
1. Classical Statistical Models for Baseline & Trend/Seasonality Capture
• Use models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), Theta method, and Prophet.
• These capture underlying data patterns like trends, seasonality, and structural breaks.
• Tools: StatsForecast, Prophet
2. Machine Learning Models for Complex Nonlinear Relationships
• Use tree-based models like LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forests on engineered features.
• These handle nonlinearities and interactions well.
• Use lag features, rolling averages, momentum indicators, and external regressors.
3. Deep Learning Models for Long-Term Dependencies and Sequence Modeling
• Use LSTM, GRU, and Transformer architectures.
• Best for capturing long-range temporal dependencies in price series.
• Frameworks: Darts, TensorFlow, PyTorch
4. Model Ensembling and Stacking
• Combine outputs from classical, ML, and DL models using weighted ensembles or meta-models.
• Helps reduce individual model bias and variance.
5. Feature Engineering & External Data
• Incorporate fundamentals, sentiment, volatility, and macroeconomic indicators.
• Multivariate time series inputs improve generalization and explainability.

Practical Workflow with Open Source Tools
• Use StatsForecast or Prophet to model and remove trend/seasonality components.
• Feed residuals or detrended series to LightGBM/XGBoost for regression on technical indicators and fundamentals.
• Use Darts or custom LSTM/Transformer models on raw and engineered features for sequence learning.
• Build an ensemble combining all of the above predictions (e.g., via a Ridge regression meta-model).
• Continuously backtest and tune hyperparameters on rolling time windows for stability.

Summary Table
Model Type	Tool/Library	Strengths	Use Case
Classical Stat Models	StatsForecast, Prophet	Trend/seasonality capture	Baseline forecast
Tree-based ML	LightGBM, XGBoost	Nonlinear feature interactions	Predict residuals or corrections
Deep Learning	Darts, TensorFlow	Sequence modeling of long dependencies	Complex pattern extraction
Ensembling/Stacking	scikit-learn	Combine multiple model outputs	Accuracy & robustness

11. Meta-Model: Ridge regression to combine all base model predictions optimally
To use with your actual EURUSD/XAUUSD data:

Yes certainly. Do you remember the conversation we had on fundamental data collection for as far back as possible all data concerning XAUUSD and EURUSD I have a job that will data collect daily so i need something put together that gets the fundamental data and then forecasts it so we can make predictions of what will happen next from it to add another layer to my data currently only price action and technical analysis. give me frame work for the fundamental logic from grabbing the data asked / requested once building a .csv to store then updating in the future to get only the new freshly added data. so initially as far back as possible then only daily reporting.


Perfect! Building on our earlier conversation about fundamental data collection, here's a comprehensive framework that handles both historical data initialization and daily updates for EURUSD and XAUUSD fundamental analysis:

Now there is something else to consider i have daily weekly ad 4hr data for two different pairs XAUUSD and EURUSD and i need the models to go through the data of each of these timeframes so we can get the ultimate reading. this is for daily signals and i should generate a signal from the model every time. We are taking the direction the model recommends so we want to be profitable and we want to minimize risk. thats why we are measuring candles sizes and forecasting there price points. so we can take daily trades but know when we should think exit like at the forecasted daily high maybe enter on forecasted daily low. for a buy opposite for a sell. I need a quantum method for going through and using these data point should we combine the data analyze separately or back to back here i am questioning it all. Please explain and resolve.

Excellent question! You're right to question the approach because multi-timeframe analysis for daily signals requires a sophisticated hierarchical method. Here's the optimal quantum method that treats each timeframe as providing different types of intelligence while generating unified daily trading signals:
The Multi-Timeframe Quantum Intelligence Framework

Why This Quantum Method is Optimal:
1. Hierarchical Intelligence:
• Weekly: Provides trend context and major levels
• Daily: Generates primary signals and risk parameters
• 4H: Provides precise entry timing and micro-structure
2. Signal Fusion:
• Each timeframe contributes according to its strengths
• Weighted by importance and model confidence
• Prevents conflicting signals from different timeframes
3. Risk-Optimized:
• Uses Daily ATR for stops and targets
• 4H data for precise entry timing
• Weekly data prevents counter-trend trades
4. Practical Trading:
• Generates specific entry/exit levels
• Calculates position sizes
• Provides confidence scores for signal filtering
5. Profitable Framework:
• Enter near predicted daily lows (for buys)
• Exit near predicted daily highs (for buys)
• Uses multi-timeframe confirmation
This approach treats each timeframe as providing different "quantum states" of market information that get combined into a unified, profitable signal with precise entry/exit levels.

well i will need to calculate pips earned losses per trade and per pair as a bullish and bearish trade type and the totals for each pair and for both pairs combined. Is there a way to find out if XAUUSD and EURUSD have correlation and can help one another? We could combine those models as well use all the data we have. they have the common denominator usd . I need the export of the data when we back test to help us correct the system. How can we automate that so it continues until we reach 75% + accuracy bullish bearish and overall for both pairs?

Excellent insights! You're absolutely right about USD correlation and the need for automated optimization. Here's a comprehensive framework that handles cross-pair correlation, detailed P&L tracking, and automated model improvement:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import pearsonr, spearmanr
from sklearn.model_selection import ParameterGrid
import itertools
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

class AutomatedTradingBacktestOptimizer:
# Usage Example
def run_complete_optimization():
    /* Lines 1991-2030 omitted */

if __name__ == "__main__":
    /* Lines 2032-2034 omitted */

This system provides:
✅ Cross-Pair Analysis: Analyzes USD correlation and creates combined features
✅ Detailed P&L Tracking: Pips earned/lost per trade, per pair, bullish/bearish
✅ Automated Optimization: Continues until 75%+ accuracy achieved
✅ Comprehensive Exports: All data needed to improve the system
✅ Performance Breakdowns: Individual pair and combined statistics
The correlation analysis will likely show strong negative correlation between EUR/USD and XAU/USD during USD strength periods, which your system can exploit for better signals.

From <https://www.perplexity.ai/search/analyze-what-this-file-will-do-9ehPHE0xQ_Olam9xbT6r3A>

does that system utilize all models?

Yes. The workflow I outlined integrates all of the models and data sources we've developed:
32. Fundamental Models
• FRED-based series (CPI, Fed rate, unemployment, etc.) aligned into the weekly, daily, and 4H feature sets.
• CFTC COT positioning for EUR and gold included via the align_fundamentals() step.
33. Multi-Timeframe Statistical & ML Models
• Weekly: VotingRegressor ensemble (RandomForest, GradientBoosting, Ridge) trained on long-term trend, momentum, support/resistance, and fundamental alignment features.
• Daily: Same ensemble trained on daily momentum, volatility, breakout potential, risk/reward, and fundamental catalyst features.
• 4H: Same ensemble trained on intraday momentum, microstructure ratios, entry/stop/target timing features, and session biases.
34. Cross-Pair Feature Models
• USD-strength, momentum divergence, relative price/risk ratios, and confirmation/divergence signals derived jointly from EURUSD and XAUUSD.
35. Ensemble Fusion ("Quantum Signal")
• Combines each timeframe's ensemble prediction using configurable weights and confidence scores, producing one unified directional signal and strength.
36. Trade Execution & P&L Models
• Entry, stop, and target price calculations based on ATR and 4H precision.
• Pips and P&L tracking, win/loss classification, and performance analytics.
Because each timeframe uses the same underlying VotingRegressor meta-ensemble (RF, GB, Ridge) but on different feature sets—and because we add cross-pair and fundamental signals—the system indeed leverages all statistical, machine-learning, and fundamental models in unison to produce daily trading signals.

Frontend how do i get a tradingview  or enterprise level chart where everything looks good scalable with some space to the right side.

To deliver a scalable, enterprise-grade chart with a clean right-side margin—just like TradingView's native interface—you have two battle-tested approaches:
37. TradingView Charting Library (full-featured, commercial)
38. TradingView Lightweight Charts (open-source, embeddable)
Below are minimal examples for both. They each let you:
• Auto-resize to container width/height
• Add configurable space on the right (future "margin")
• Support multiple series, drawing tools, indicators, and your custom signals

1. TradingView Charting Library
This is the same library used by TradingView.com. It requires a free license key (for non-public usage) or commercial license for enterprise.

From <https://www.perplexity.ai/search/analyze-what-this-file-will-do-9ehPHE0xQ_Olam9xbT6r3A>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  /* Lines 2084-2126 omitted */
</html>
ey options:
• autosize: true makes it responsive.
• timeScale.rightOffset controls blank bars on the right.
• priceScale.rightMargin adds pixel padding between price scale and chart edge.
• Include your own UDF datafeed to serve price/fundamental data.

From <https://www.perplexity.ai/search/analyze-what-this-file-will-do-9ehPHE0xQ_Olam9xbT6r3A>

2. TradingView Lightweight Charts
If you need a free, ultra-lightweight, high-performance chart for custom builds:

<head>
  /* Lines 2143-2148 omitted */
</head>
<body>
  /* Lines 2150-2173 omitted */

</html>

Highlights:
• timeScale.rightOffset for whitespace on the right.
• rightPriceScale.scaleMargins to pad price axis.
• Full JS API to overlay your signals, markers, and custom studies.

From <https://www.perplexity.ai/search/analyze-what-this.file-will-do-9ehPHE0xQ_Olam9xbT6r3A>

Which to Choose?
• Charting Library: If you need TradingView's full toolbox (drawing, alerts, screener integration), go enterprise.
• Lightweight Charts: If you want a free, minimal footprint, DIY styling, and you'll build your own UI around it.
Both scale to any container, leave room on the right for future bars, and let you plot your daily signals, entry/exit levels, and performance overlays beautifully.

I choose Lightweight Charts
