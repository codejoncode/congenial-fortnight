## Model Integration and Signal Generation## Model Integration and Signal Generation



The core ML logic is in `daily_forex_signal_system.py`, which trains and predicts signals using an ensemble of Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB) models, calibrated with isotonic regression for confidence scoring. The `generate_signal` method processes the latest data window to produce signals.The core ML logic is in `daily_forex_signal_system.py`, which trains and predicts signals using an ensemble of Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB) models, calibrated with isotonic regression for confidence scoring.

**Note**: Unlike the daily signal models, candle prediction models don't have `_calibrator.joblib` files because they use **regression** (predicting OHLC values) instead of **classification** (predicting bullish/bearish). Calibration is only needed for classification models to improve probability estimates.**Note**: Unlike the daily signal models, candle prediction models don't have `_calibrator.joblib` files because they use **regression** (predicting OHLC values) instead of **classification** (predicting bullish/bearish).
