# Lean Six Sigma Roadmap to 85% Directional Accuracy

## üî≠ Goal Alignment
Locking onto the 85% accuracy goal, here‚Äôs the Lean Six Sigma game plan staged for execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è High-Level Plan
1. **Define & Measure** ‚Äì Formalize CTQs, baseline accuracy/P&L metrics, and automate data integrity checks.
2. **Analyze** ‚Äì Run SHAP/permutation studies, isolate failure regimes, and map Google Cloud build blockers.
3. **Improve** ‚Äì Roll out feature expansion, new pattern/fundamental engines, specialized models, stacked ensemble, and walk-forward backtesting with slippage.
4. **Control** ‚Äì Stand up live monitoring, retrain triggers, and codify the Google Cloud deployment playbook.

## üéØ Lean Six Sigma Roadmap Highlights
- **CTQs** set at 85% directional accuracy (per pair), ‚â•70% for the ensemble, and tight candle MAE targets.
- **Measurement** includes automated accuracy logging, schema validation for the new H1/Monthly feeds, and expanded diagnostics (Holloway counts, pattern hits, macro surprises).
- **Analysis** drives SHAP/permutation reviews, misclassification clustering by regime, and a documented root-cause review of Cloud build failures.
- **Improvement** covers:
  - Holloway count expos√©s + support/resistance bands.
  - Multi-timeframe RSI/MA/MACD, pattern detectors, harmonic & Elliott approximations.
  - Macro ingestion (rates, PMI surprises, CFTC positioning).
  - Candle CNN/LSTM, pair/timeframe classifiers with class weighting or focal loss.
  - Meta-learner replacement for the equal-weight vote.
  - Slippage-aware simulator feeding walk-forward/rolling backtests straight into the stacked ensemble.
  - Automation and CI hooks to keep pipelines reproducible and GCP-ready.
- **Control** locks in dashboards, alert thresholds (XAUUSD 75%, EURUSD 70%), quarterly DMAIC retrospectives, and a hardened deployment checklist with automated smoke tests.

## üöÄ Tactical Backlog (0‚Äì60 Days)
1. Feature enrichment (Holloway bands, multi-TF indicators).
2. Pattern & harmonic detector modules.
3. Fundamental data integration (calendar, rates, CFTC).
4. Model rebuild (candle CNN/LSTM + pair-specific classifiers).
5. Meta-learner stack.
6. Backtesting engine with walk-forward automation.
7. Bayesian/random hyperparameter search with early stopping.
8. Monitoring and alerting rollout.

## üìù Documentation Update
- Added a full **‚ÄúLean Six Sigma Roadmap to 85% Directional Accuracy‚Äù** section to `Holloway_Algorithm_Implementation.md`, including DMAIC phases, tactical backlog, and GCP deployment alignment guidance.

## ‚úÖ Requirements Coverage
- **Roadmap & Plan:** Done (Lean Six Sigma DMAIC plan with tactical backlog).
- **Documentation Update:** Done (`Holloway_Algorithm_Implementation.md` extended).
